scikit-learn example using the datase from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition.

To run the script copy the file [data.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00388/data.csv) into your local working directory.

The script will create, execucute two models:
- a binary model to classify seizure (1) vs non-seizure (2, 3, 4, 5)
- a model to do multiclass classification.
